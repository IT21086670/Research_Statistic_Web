              <h2>Intelligent Fire Detection and Response System with Dynamic Nozzle Control and Evacuation Planning</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>What is the Intelligent Fire Detection and Response System?</strong>  
                      This system is an advanced, multi-component fire management solution that identifies fire types, tracks fire spread, and controls nozzle activation to extinguish fires effectively.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>What fire types can the system detect?</strong>  
                      Currently, the system can detect Type A (solids like wood and paper), Type B (flammable liquids), and Type C (flammable gases) fires. Future versions aim to include additional fire types.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How does the system identify different fire types?</strong>  
                      Using a combination of sensors—temperature (DHT11), smoke (MQ7), and LPG (MQ6)—the system classifies fires into types using a machine learning model trained on multi-sensor data.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>What makes this system different from traditional fire alarms?</strong>  
                      Unlike traditional alarms that often use a single sensor type, this system integrates multiple sensors and machine learning to accurately identify specific fire types and trigger targeted suppression methods.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Can the system be used in residential and commercial settings?</strong>  
                      Yes, this system is adaptable for both residential and commercial settings, including industrial facilities, offices, and warehouses.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How does the dynamic nozzle control work?</strong>  
                      The nozzle adjusts automatically based on the fire’s severity and spread, controlling water pressure and angle to ensure effective fire suppression.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>What sensors are used in this system?</strong>  
                      The system uses DHT11 temperature sensors, MQ7 smoke sensors, and MQ6 LPG gas sensors, each capturing key data points to classify and respond to fires.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How often does the system update fire severity data?</strong>  
                      The system logs data every five seconds, updating the fire severity and spread information in real-time to provide timely responses.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Does the system include an evacuation planning feature?</strong>  
                      Yes, it can generate evacuation routes based on the fire’s location, type, and severity to ensure safe and efficient evacuation.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How is machine learning used in fire detection?</strong>  
                      Machine learning algorithms analyze sensor data to recognize patterns specific to each fire type, allowing the system to classify fires accurately and adapt to new data over time.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How accurate is the system in identifying fire types?</strong>  
                      Through rigorous testing and machine learning optimization, the system achieves high accuracy rates, particularly in distinguishing between Types B and C fires.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How does the system handle small fires like cooking or cigarette fires?</strong>  
                      The system only activates the nozzle when fire severity reaches a certain threshold (20%), preventing unnecessary water discharge for minor incidents.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>What safety measures are in place if the system fails?</strong>  
                      The system is designed with redundant sensors and failsafe mechanisms to ensure reliable operation. In case of sensor or communication failure, an alert is sent to the central monitoring team.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Can the system be integrated with existing fire alarms?</strong>  
                      Yes, it can be integrated with existing alarm systems to enhance fire detection capabilities and response mechanisms.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How does the camera-based tracking system work?</strong>  
                      The system uses YOLOv8-based RGB image analysis to detect and monitor the spread of flames. If flames cover more than 20% of the camera’s field of view, the severity level is updated accordingly.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>What is the installation process for the system?</strong>  
                      Installation involves setting up sensors, connecting the camera-based tracking system, and configuring the control unit. A professional technician will handle installation to ensure accuracy and safety.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How often does the system require maintenance?</strong>  
                      Regular maintenance is recommended every six months to ensure sensor accuracy and optimal system performance.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Can the system be upgraded as new technology becomes available?</strong>  
                      Yes, the system is designed for scalability and can be updated with new sensors, machine learning models, or software enhancements as they become available.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Does the system require a constant internet connection?</strong>  
                      While internet connectivity enhances features like remote monitoring, the core fire detection and response functions operate independently to ensure reliability.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>How does the system contribute to overall fire safety?</strong>  
                      By accurately identifying fire types, controlling suppression mechanisms, and guiding evacuation, this system enhances fire safety in diverse environments, protecting both lives and property.
